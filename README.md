## Objectives
Learning how to make API calls to the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/start) using JQuery and Ajax. With the data returned in JSON we used a Mustache template to render the results and then attached it to the DOM.

We also used the HTML5 geolocation to get the current position of the browser and used [GMaps.js](http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/) to display the location of the results on google maps.

## What to do
Take out the logic of the API calls and parsing of data into seperate Javascript objects and TDD those using Jasmine. Since we were playing around, we left it all in the presentation layer.

## Tech Stack
* Javascript
